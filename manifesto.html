    <h1>TRACKER-TRACKER MANIFESTO</h1>

    <p>THE EXISTING PERSONAL INFORMATICS FRAMEWORK cannot subdue the human force that is increasing day by day alongside the irresistible development of self-optimizing technology to resist the assistance afforded by sensing and visualization techniques through self-sabotage through evasion of one's own self-quantification.</p>

    <p>The tendency to avoid data-driven confrontation of the self in each person cannot be disciplined amongst a collection of separate data sources, but only by challenged en bloc through data aggregation. All real progress has clearly been suspended until the revolutionary solution of the present multiform crisis:</p>

    <p>We will build a prototype tool that effectively takes information from a variety of sources and streamlines the data into modules organized around days; this tracker-tracker visualizes whether a tracking tool was used for a given day and presents the results to promote radical self-accountability.</p>

    <p>Soon the day will come when we will inaugurate what will historically be the last of the technological arts: data-driven self discipline. Not only shall we enable everyone to track their behaviors and scrutinize themselves for opportunities to improve their behaviors, but we will track our own successes and failures in tracking ourselves. All previous attempts to curtail the benefits of self-knowledge through ignorance will be superseded by rigorous meta-quantification.</p>

    <p>We look with bright anticipation toward the time of easily liberated personal data. To support our meta-tracking endeavors, the initial tier of data-gathering will innovate for graceful data aggregation. We also eagerly await the counsels of social psychologists who will present to us the most effective design strategies for persuasion and enforcement of desired tracking behavior.</p>

    <p>To those who don't understand us properly, we say with an irreducible scorn: "The tracker-trackers of which you believe yourselves perhaps to be the judges, will one day judge you. We await the turning point which is the inevitable liquidation of the world of personal informatics system attrition in all its forms. Such are our goals, and these will be the future goals of humanity."</p>

    <p>(Borrowed generously from other manifestos, namely the situationist one.)</p>
